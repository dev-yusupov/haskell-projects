-- Functional Programming end-term

-- This solution was submitted and prepared by
-- <NAME, NEPTUN> for the end-term programming assignment of
-- the Functional Programming course.

-- I declare that this solution is my own work.

-- I have not copied or used third-party solutions.

-- I have not passed my solution to my classmates, neither made it public.

-- Students' regulation of Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C.)
-- states that as long as a student presents another studentâ€™s work -
-- or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance,
-- it will count as a disciplinary fault.

-- The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal
-- of the student from the University.

-- Record Student. (10 points)

Create an Algebraic type `StudyLevel` which can have
 3 values: `BSc`, `MSc`, `PhD`.
 Create a record `Student` which has 3 fields:
 * id - A string id
 * level - A study level with type `StudyLevel`
 * grades - A list of grades, where each grade is an integer
 Write a `getBestBScStudent` function that takes a list of students
 and returns a string ID of the student who has highest average grade
 among BSc students. Assume that the list contains at least one BSc student.
 If multiple students have same maximum average return any of their IDs.
